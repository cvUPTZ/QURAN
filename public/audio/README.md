# Audio Files Directory

This directory contains placeholder audio files for Quran recitation. In a production environment, these would be actual audio files of Quran recitation.

The application is designed to work with audio files organized by reciter name and page number, in the format `/audio/[reciter_id]/page[number].mp3`.

Since we're experiencing issues with audio playback, these are empty placeholder files to demonstrate the structure.
