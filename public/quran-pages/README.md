# Quran Pages Directory

This directory contains placeholder images for Quran pages. In a production environment, these would be actual Quran page images.

The application is designed to work with images named in the format `page001.png`, `page002.png`, etc.

Since we're experiencing network issues with the remote Quran images, we're using local placeholders instead.
